This is the personal journal of me, Brian Burnley.  The format is hardly condusive to riveting reading: each entry is a month, I add the numeric date followed by a colon and then list what I did that day.  Repeat ad infinitum.  Occasionally you'll see a sort of "to-do" list, in which a future date is listed (with items described in the *past* tense!).  The reason for that should be clear... I have a third eye that sees all that what will come to pass.

My intention with Dymaxion is to offer a record to posterity of what I'm spending my days on.  Posterity here being mostly me, since periodic review of the entries should crystalize in my head areas in which I'm strong and (more imporatantly) areas of opportunity for improvement.  I also find it enjoyable to have a "down in the trenches" report from past versions of myself.  Not really nostalgia, but more like meeting a friend you haven't seen in a while and who had a strong impact on you.  So that's why Dymaxion exists at all.  But why is it publicly accessible?  Firstly, I don't believe that the secrecy and blushiness most people associate with journals and diaries is very applicable here.  Dymaxion will be frank, but not scandalous.  (For that, await my posting the audio logs from my dream journal.)  Secondly, I think close collegues and friends could potentially benefit from the record, as it means they get a peripheral journal of their lives and actions with no time or energy spent.  Finally, and most critically, transparency and accountability are hallmarks of good work.  Public Dymaxion is incentive for me to do my best always - there won't be a "rocketing onto the scene" that we associate with success, but a steady and well-documented personal ascent.

Thanks for visiting.
